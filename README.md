This guide explains everything about Unacademy coupon codes and shows how to use the special code **PLUSMXNDC** to get up to **90% discount** on your subscription.[1][2]

## What Is Unacademy?

Unacademy is an online learning platform that helps learners prepare for exams like UPSC CSE, IIT JEE, NEET UG, CAT, GATE, CA, NET, Banking, Judiciary and more through live and recorded classes. The app brings India’s top educators together and offers mock tests, doubt-solving sessions and structured batches for different goals.[2][1]

Coupon codes and referral codes reduce the effective price through flat discounts, percentage-based offers and special festival deals.[3][4][5][2]

Different coupon websites regularly list Unacademy promo codes that provide up to around 50–70% off plus extra percentage discounts on Plus and Iconic plans, depending on the goal and duration. Using a valid coupon code at checkout ensures you get the lowest possible price at the time of purchase.[4][5][3]
